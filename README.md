# vagrant-k8s

Following this tutorial (<https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/03/15/kubernetes-setup-using-ansible-and-vagrant/>) to learning about Kubernetes and Ansible in order to have a dev environment running in Vagrant.

This repository uses Ubuntu 18.04 and the latest Kubernetes 1.20.

I'm attempting to annotate any changes from the original article.
